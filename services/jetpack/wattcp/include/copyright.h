 *
 *   RESTRICTIONS
 *   ------------
 *   You may freely use this library to produce programs which you may give
 *   away or sell in source format, or as compiled executables, or both.
 *
 *   You may not sell this library or a portion thereof or distribute modified
 *   versions the library code in either source or OBJect or LIBrary format
 *   without written permission from the author.  The author still maintains
 *   copyright privileges and will assert the privileges of ownership for
 *   purposes of royalties such distributions.
 *
 *   Portions of this code were written or enhanced by others and offerred
 *   to me for distribution in WATTCP under my copyright.  To my knowledge,
 *   all copyrights exercised are listed at the top of this file.  If this
 *   is incorrect, please contact me so I can rectify the situation.
 *
 *
 *   OFFICIAL SITE
 *   -------------
 *   The official distribution site for WATTCP (and many other TCP goodies)
 *   is dorm.rutgers.edu in pub/msdos/wattcp  (thanks Jim!)
 *
 *   That is where I upload the latest libraries, my own free applications
 *   and other applications I have collected and find useful.
 *
 *
 *   DOCUMENTATION
 *   -------------
 *   A programmer's reference manual I wrote is now available from the
 *   publisher.  They provide no additional support and cannot help
 *   you with any aspect of the software.  But they do pay a royalty
 *   to me which has been used to compensate my costs for developing
 *   this software and extending it, so I am very appreciative.
 *
 *   That manual is copyrighted and protected by international law.
 *   It may not be copied without the authors permission.  And its
 *   sale does not constitute a warranty or an automatic license to
 *   use WATTCP beyond the terms described in this file.
