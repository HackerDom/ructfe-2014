2.0 A brief description of EN1
------------------------------------------------------------

EN1 release  is  a British English  diphone  database
provided in the context of the MBROLA project :

   http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html

It  provides a British English male voice (known as "Roger∆s
voice")  to  be used with the MBROLA program.  It  has  been
built  from  the original Roger diphones made  available  by
CSTR, University of Edinburgh, as part of their generic text-
to-speech system FESTIVAL :

   http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html

Input  files use the SAMPA phonetic notation, as adopted  in
other  MBROLA  databases. Below is a  list  of  the  English
speech  sounds it accounts for, with examples. We also  give
the  correspondence with the MRPA phonetic notation used  in
the  original distribution of Roger∆s voice in the  FESTIVAL
TTS system.

                    u@      U@      poor

MRPA also actually defines two allophones of [l] : a "light"
one  [l],  as  in  "list",  and a "dark"  one  [ll],  as  in
"festival". We have used the character found in the  IPA-SAM
Truetype font [5].

                    ll      5       bolt

Additionally, the notation for silence is the  one  used  in
previous mbrola databases : _ (MRPA uses #).

However,  in  order to maintain a strict compatibility  with
the  MRPA  notation, and to allow any other notation  to  be
used as well, we have included in the distribution of en1  a
configuration  file which performs automatic MRPA  to  SAMPA
phoneme  mapping  (as  accepted  by  the  latest  version of
mbrola; see below).

Notice  finally that there is no support for SAMPA's glottal
stop  (?,  as in "network" [ne?w3:k]) nor for the  voiceless
velar fricative (x, as in "loch" [lQx]).

Limitations:
-----------
In  the FESTIVAL distribution of Roger's voice, not all 2116
diphones (i.e. 46x46) are available.

For reasons of compactness, some diphones (like e-dZ and  e-
d,  for instance) have been mapped into a single unit.  This
should  not  have  a  major  influence  on  the  quality  of
synthetic speech.

Notice  also that not all diphones are possible  in  English
(like  f-ng,  for  instance). However,  in  order  to  avoid
problems   when   trying  to  synthesize   such   impossible
combinations,  we  have  systematically  mapped   impossible
diphones to 3:-@ (as done by FESTIVAL itself).

------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution of mbrola contains the following files :

   en1         : the database itself
   en1mrpa     : a configuration file, which can follow en1
                 on the command line, and enables automatic
                 phoneme  mapping  for use  with  the  MRPA 
                 notation.
   readme.txt  : this file

and several example .PHO files :

   mbrola.pho  : a small introduction to mbrola
   mbrolamr.pho: same thing, MRPA notation
   euler.pho   : a famous  quotation by  Swiss mathematician
                 Leonhard Euler
   eulerfr.pho : same thing in French with an English accent
   tobe.pho    : mbrola metaphysics

Additional  languages and voices, as well as  other  example
command  files, are or will be available in the  context  of
the  MBROLA  project.  Please  consult  the  MBROLA  project
homepage :

   http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html

Registered  users  will automatically  be  notified  of  the
availability  of  new databases. To freely register,  simply
send  an  email  to  mbrola-interest-request@tcts.fpms.ac.be
with the word 'subscribe' in the message title.

------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 Installation and Tests
------------------------------------------------------------

If  you  have not copied the MBROLA software yet, or if  you
have  an  older  version, please consult the MBROLA  project
homepage and get it.

Copy en1.zip into the mbrola directory and unzip it :
     
   unzip en1.zip (or pkunzip on PC/DOS)
   (don't forget to delete the .zip file when this is done)

Try
     
   mbrola en1 euler.pho euler.wav

to  create  a  sound file. In this example  the  audio  file
follows  the  RIFF  Wav  format.  But,  depending   on   the
extension, euler.au, euler.aif, or euler.raw, you can obtain
other  file  formats. Listen to it with your favorite  sound
editor, and try other command files (*.pho) to have a better
idea  of  the quality of speech you can synthesize with  the
MBROLA technique.

On  Unix  systems you can pipe the audio ouput to the  sound
player. On a HP, for instance, do:

   mbrola en1 euler.pho - | splayer -srate 16000 -l16

Also refer to the readme.txt file provided with the mbrola
software for using it.

You   can   also  very  easily  use  the  MRPA  input   file
eulermrp.pho :

   mbrola en1 en1mrpa eulermrp.pho euler.wav

5.0 Acknowledgments
------------------------------------------------------------

We  would  like  to  thank  Alan Black,  Paul Taylor,  Roger
Burroughes, Alistair Conkie, and Sue Fitt for the remarkable
contribution  they have made  to  free speech  synthesis  by 
making the original Roger diphone database freely  available 
without any restriction of use.

It  should  be  noted  in  that  respect  that  mbrola-based
synthesis using en1 is fully supported by the Festival text-
to-speech system developed at CSTR and available at :

   http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html

(Other possible uses of the mbrola speech synthesizer  within
complete TTS systems are listed at :
